##  Features

- Convert `YouTube` or `local` video files into boot animations
-  Scale bootanimations to desired resolution and FPS

##  Requirements

> **Warning**: Ensure these dependencies are installed. Though the script will attempt to install missing dependencies.

- **FFmpeg and FFprobe**: Used for extracting information and frames from the video
- **Zip**: Used for creating the `bootanimation.zip`
- **yt-dlp**: Download YouTube videos (if selected as input)


###  Termux-Specific Setup
- Since `Termux` doesn't have yt-dlp in their repositories , you need to run this commands first if you want to use youtube to bootanimation converter
```
termux-setup-storage && pkg install -y openssl-tool python && pip install yt-dlp
```


# How To Use?
- Copy and paste this below command in `linux terminal` or `termux`
```
bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhythmcache/Video-to-BootAnimation-Creator-Script/main/cbootanim.sh)
```

> [!Tip] 
> - Choose either `YouTube` video or `local video` as the source
> - Select desired resolution for `YouTube` videos
> - Choose custom configuration or video default configuration to create `bootanimation`
> - Script generates a flashable Magisk module
> - Flash created zip in Magisk, KernelSU, or aPatch
> - Recommended to select `loop animation` if your video is too short or if its a gif.



## Use As Command-Line
- ⚠️ These are `unmaintained` and has less features
- [Download This](https://github.com/rhythmcache/Video-to-BootAnimation-Creator-Script/releases/download/V2/bootc) and give executable permission
- it will create just a bootanimation.zip (not module)
- General Syntax to use for creating a looped boot-animation 
```
bootc -i <path to video file> <resolution> <fps> loop <output/path/bootanimation.zip>
```
- General Syntax to use for creating a non-looped boot-animation (same just remove the loop)
```
bootc -i <path to video file> <resolution> <fps <output/path/bootanimation.zip>
